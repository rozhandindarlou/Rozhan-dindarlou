""" The Explanation of the Code:
In this code, we start by defining the size of the square matrices to be multiplied (matrix_size). 
We then generate two random matrices (matrix_a and matrix_b) using the np.random.rand function.

We define two functions: cpu_matrix_multiplication and gpu_matrix_multiplication, 
which perform matrix multiplication using CPU and GPU, respectively. 

In the CPU function, we use the NumPy np.dot function for matrix multiplication. 
In the GPU function, we use the cp.asarray function from the cupy library 
to transfer the matrices to the GPU, perform matrix multiplication using cp.dot, 
and then transfer the result back to the CPU using cp.asnumpy.

After running the CPU and GPU matrix multiplication functions, 
we can optionally compare the results and print the execution times.

Please note that for the GPU matrix multiplication to work, 
you need to have the cupy library installed, which provides 
a NumPy-compatible interface for GPU computations. 
Also, make sure you have a compatible GPU and CUDA drivers installed.

Feel free to adjust the matrix size and modify the code according to your specific requirements.
